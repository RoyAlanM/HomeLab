# Welcome to my Wireshark Home Lab Project repository! This project is part of my ongoing efforts to showcase my Wireshark skills and network analysis capabilities.
# In this repository, you'll find a collection of pcap (packet capture) files captured from various scenarios within my home lab environment. Each pcap file represents a different network activity or event, providing opportunities for analysis and exploration using Wireshark, the leading network protocol analyzer.
